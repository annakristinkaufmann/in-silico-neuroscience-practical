    "\n",
    "Neuroscience - like many other scientific fields - produces a vast amount of data. It is important to enable good data management to support scientific discovery. Some of the challenges of data management include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heterogeneity of data (e.g. morphology reconstructions, electrophysiology recordings, whole-brain imaging, simulations, validations)\n",
    "* Varying size of datasets (small to large)\n",
    "* Data is often stored in distributed silos (lab servers, personal computers, dropbox, google drive)\n",
    "* Data provenance is often not easily accessible (metadata kept in different spreadsheets, hand-written labbooks, not captured)\n",

The acronym stands for: **Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability**. They are a set of principles intended to help enhance the reusability of scientific data with specific emphasis on usability of data by both machines and humans. \n",

    "Amy is a computational neuroscientist working with single cell models of the somatosensory cortex. Her model uses experimental data collected by Brian, an experimental neuroscientist using *in vitro* patch clamp recording techniques for his research, producing both electrophysiology as well as morphology data. To facilitate access to the experimental data for Amy, Brian wants to use Blue Brain Nexus to integrate his experimental data (both files and respective metadata). This is an example page taken from **Brian's labbook** containing the relevant metadata of the experiment he wants to add to Blue Brain Nexus:\n",

    "If you want to provide Blue Brain Nexus with a data instance of e.g. a subject like a rat, it is important to know exactly how that data instance of a subject should be organised, what metadata properties it should come with, which of those are optional (e.g. the weight of the subjcet, because the information is not always available) and which of them should be required (e.g. the species the subject belongs to). This is where schemas come into place: Schemas define properties an entity has and help further constrain them. In the case of Blue Brain Nexus, schemas are written in the so-called **Shapes Constraint Language** (SHACL): https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/ and stored in JSON-LD format. For the following exercise, use the online JSON editor to inspect the provided schemas for Subject, Neuron and Dataset, familiarise yourself with the structure of the schemas and the properties provided and extend the Subject schema with a property \"strain\" (to access the schemas, click on the links below):\n",
