    "\n",
    "Neuroscience - like many other scientific fields - produces a vast amount of data. It is important to enable good data management to support scientific discovery. Some of the challenges of data management include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heterogeneity of data (e.g. morphology reconstructions, electrophysiology recordings, whole-brain imaging, simulations, validations)\n",
    "* Varying size of datasets (small to large)\n",
    "* Data is often stored in distributed silos (lab servers, personal computers, dropbox, google drive)\n",
    "* Data provenance is often not easily accessible (metadata kept in different spreadsheets, hand-written labbooks, not captured)\n",

The acronym stands for: **Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability**. They are a set of principles intended to help enhance the reusability of scientific data with specific emphasis on usability of data by both machines and humans. \n",

    "Amy is a computational neuroscientist working with single cell models of the somatosensory cortex. Her model uses experimental data collected by Brian, an experimental neuroscientist using *in vitro* patch-clamp recording techniques for his research, producing both electrophysiology as well as morphology data. To facilitate access to the data for Amy, Brian wants to use Blue Brain Nexus to integrate it (both files and respective metadata). This is an example page taken from **Brian's labbook** containing the relevant metadata of the experiment he wants to make available to Amy t Blue Brain Nexus:\n",

This is where schemas come into place: Schemas define properties an entity has and help further constrain them. In the case of Nexus, schemas are written in the so-called **Shapes Constraint Language** (SHACL): https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/ and stored in JSON-LD format. \n",
